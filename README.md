By taking the marketing _campaign csv file from the kaggle applied the data cleaning methods , as the first part of data analysis 
         1.  First of all, I load the dataset into the jupyter notebook and then to understand structure and components of dataset
             that means what actually is this about , I apply some basic methods in python
         2.  And next I apply the cleaning methods that is checking null values by isnull() method and dropping duplicates by the
             drop_duplicates() method 
         3.  To make the dataset to look clean format, I apply the standardize text format methods and fixing the all datatypes in 
             their original ones for example data as datetime format age as int format like that
         4.  At last, I create the dataset in cleaner format that is 'cleaned_marketing_campaign.csv'.
